# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# passenger1 = Passenger.create()

# taxi1 = Taxi.create(model: "Crown Victorian", license_plate: "92cny65")

# ride = Ride.create(passenger: passenger1, taxi: taxi1)
